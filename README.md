### One Style to Rule Them All

No decisions to make. No `.eslintrc`, `.jshintrc`, or `.jscsrc` files to manage. It just
works.

This module saves you (and others!) time in two ways:

- **No configuration.** The easiest way to enforce consistent style in your project. Just
  drop it in.
- **Catch style errors before they're submitted in PRs.** Saves precious code review time
  by eliminating back-and-forth between maintainer and contributor.

This is a linter for the future, based on the [standard linter]. It expects to be run within a babel environment, using the latest available babel syntax.

## Rule Differences from Standard

* Always require parens for arrow functions, [arrow-parens]: always.
* Require commas in a multi-line block, [comma-dangle]: "always-multiline".
* Arrow functions everywhere, [prefer-arrow-callback].
* Prefer spread instead of .apply where possible, [prefer-spread].
* Template strings, [prefer-template].

[comma-dangle]: http://eslint.org/docs/rules/comma-dangle.html
[object-shorthand]: http://eslint.org/docs/rules/object-shorthand.html
[prefer-arrow-callback]: http://eslint.org/docs/rules/prefer-arrow-callback.html
[prefer-spread]: http://eslint.org/docs/rules/prefer-spread.html
[prefer-template]: http://eslint.org/docs/rules/prefer-template.html

## Methodology Differences from Standard

* We will freely update rules based on current best practices. Becuase of this we recommend that you lock down the current version of modern-standard.
* We are currently only targeting the latest javascript syntax, generally this code is transpiled by [babel].
* We want to move faster and be more receptive to community issues and contributions.
* Everything is under one organization, and all linting code is in a single repo. This makes it much easier for contributors.
* This is an experiment and we're happy if standard adopts these rules or if this repository is forked.
